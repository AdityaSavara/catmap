This page presents a collection of tutorials. It is suggested that
first-time users follow the numbered tutorials sequentially since they
are aimed at teaching basic usage of the software. Tutorials 1-3 focus
on constructing a "scaled" model as a function of descriptor space, and
are the core tutorials. The other tutorials explore some additional
features and do not need to be followed sequentially. These will also be
updated as new features are added.

*If you find any errors in the tutorials please `contact the
developers <mailto:mkm-developers@stanford.edu>`__.*

After finishing the above tutorials users should be prepared to browse
the "Examples" for more examples of how to use the code and generate
more specialized micro-kinetic models. If you find this software useful
and have a working example you are encouraged to add it to the
"Examples" collection by contacting the developers at
mkm-developers@stanford.edu.

-  Example - Methane synthesis (coming soon)
-  Example - Methanol synthesis vs. T and P (coming soon)
